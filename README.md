# Getting-Started-with-APIs
# This is my first project involving APIs. I was interested in learning about what they could do so I decided to create a program to convert my YouTube liked songs into a Spotify   playlist.
# Used the Youtube Data API documentation and the Spotify API documentation to help understand how I could go about doing this project.
